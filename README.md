# Zero to Pandas Course Project: 2017 Halloween Candy Survey
For six weeks, from August to September, I was enrolled in a Python Data Analysis course through a collaboration between Jovian.ML and Freecode Camp. 

During the course, we were tasked with completing three assignments and an overall course project. This Jupyter notebook is my final course project. Since I consider the entire month of October as Halloween season, I thought it would be appropriate to analyze some Halloween related data.
